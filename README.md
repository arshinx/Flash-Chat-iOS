# Flash-Chat-iOS

Live Chat 💭 Application for iOS (with Firebase backend).

Key Concepts:
- Firebase (Realtime Database)
- Networking
- Tableviews
- Animations
- UI

## Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this tutorial we’ll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making our own cloud-based backend database. It’s going to be epic, so buckle up.

## About the project

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. I will be using a service called Firebase as a backend data server to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud.
